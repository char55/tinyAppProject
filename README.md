## Website abilities

- Registered users are capable of:
      * Creating shortened URLs for any website
      * Storing these codes and their corresponding URLs in their account
      * Any shortened URL can be shared with any user (registered or not)
      * Codes are otherwise kept private; ie: users can only see the codes they created within their index
      * Codes and URLs can be deleted
      * The URL for a specified code can be edited/updated
      * Users can log out at any time
- The date at which a URL was shortened is recorded
- The number of times each shortened URL is visited is recorded
- The number of times each shortened URL is uniquely visited is recorded
            -a single user is recorded as visiting a single time - regardless of the amount of times they visited the site
